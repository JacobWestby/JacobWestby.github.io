Express Revenge landingpage

This was originally a project from Codecademy to make a landing page for a fictional (or real) company. 
I used a random word generator to come up with the name. 
The project required that you had to use Flexbox, costom colors, costom fonts. I took it a few steps further
and made the website responsive. It even has a dropdown menue for mobile.

Im not supre happy with the design in terms of colors and stuff but im really happy with the code and layout.
